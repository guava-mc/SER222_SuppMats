# Spaced Repetition with Anki

## Downloading Anki

You can download Anki for your computer [here](https://apps.ankiweb.net)\
Anki also has a free Android app, free webapp, and an iOS app that you can purchase if you feel so inclined.

## Importing a deck

Anki decks are saved in anki packages ".apkg".

To import an apkg you have on your computer, in your Anki Application go to\
```File > Import```\
Select the apkg you wish to import, for example [ser222SRS__Week1.apkg](ser222SRS__Week1.apkg),and 'wa-la'!

It is recommended that you put all the individual apkgs into the same deck instead of having them separated by week to randomize the information being displayed and enhance your learning.



## Using Anki Right

Anki is designed to be used everyday. It uses a research proven space repetition algorithm that is designed to only show you a card when you are about to forget the material! This only works if you use it regularly.

Each time you use Anki you will only see cards that are due to be reviewed. 

For example: Say you are reviewing a new card.

If you got it right you will be shown it again in 10 minutes (or if there are no other cards to be seen during your session, whatever comes first).

If you get it right the second time, you will see it in one day. If you get it right again, 3 days, then 7, and so on until it will be years before you see it again.

This is how spaced repetition works. Your brain keeps things in short term memory and then forgets it unless you revist the material in some way. By reviewing at calculated intervals you optimize your learning and make it easier to connect new information to old and dynamically create rich nueral networks that lead to mastering material.
